---- This has been built following this guide that Varun shared (thanks man!):
https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1715&v=z8Ewd7z1WpQ&feature=emb_title

---- So far, I have implemented upto 54:00 of the video.

---- I have made a db mimicking Lance's db schema (thanks dude!) with a few modifications in the models.py file. 

---- I skipped over using Jinja because I am not convinced that we're getting any benefit doing it (22:00-30:00 in the video), because it is merely just making our files smaller at the cost of readibility.

---- The motivation to skip Jinja was that I had to keep editing some parts of the HTML because of some errors and Jinja bases and extensions were making it hard to find out the exact line I'm looking for. We CAN Jinja-fy (madeup word FYI) later if we need.

---- Added registration page as well. It was easy enough to do sooooo.

---- The app can now register new users on the register page, and can then login successfully on the login page.

-- Users can register as student and this gets recorded onto the database.

-- Registered students will show up on the manage students page by going to '/manage-students'

-- Currently working on the enabling/disabling feature of the manage students page to be connected to the database

--- Manage students is now working. Enabling/Disabling students on the page get updated in the database as well

--- Login is working as well.
